*Status Update for Final Project*

So far, we've made good progress on our final project building the game 2048 in 
Elm. Our goal so far has been to build all main gameplay logic and leave the final
graphics for the next week. 

After originally using a matrix library for our game board, we decided to refactor
our code to use a list of lists instead as we realized it would be necessary to 
have access to the distrinct rows for the transitions. The Grid is our only main
data structure, and the entirety of our model as of now, with a couple other 
type aliases we added for programming ease. 

Using the homework 2 Pi.elm file as a starting point, we followed the same format
with all of the main Elm MVC functions and edited them to suit our needs. As mentioned,
our model right now consists solely of the board but this will change over the next 
week when we add a total_score and possibly more to it. Our subscription function
uses the Browser.Events library to take in keystrokes and convert it to a Sub Msg
to be used by update. As of now, Update() takes in one of the four arrow key directions
and recursively calls update with a Tick, while any other keystoke simply does nothing. 

Similar to homework 2, a call to update with a Tick randomly generates a "play"
which consists of an index (into the flattened list of lists) and a num (either
a 2 or 4). These are then used to place a newly populated tile in after the move 
happens. 

For now, we are simply displaying the list as bullet points in our .html file but
once the gameaplay logic is done we will be spending most of our time focusing on 
fixing up the graphics so they are as similar to the original game as possible. 

Still to do:
-Finish the combine and shift functions
-Which will then allow us to build out our Left/Right/Up/Down movements
-At that point all game play logic will be done and we can focus on the View. 
-Once we clean up the view, we will start working on minor additions to the code
that will make it more similar to the actual game like
	- A score counter
	- A new game/reset button
	- Importing images to use in our graphcis





Notes to you (delete this):
-I think we should/could rename "Tick" as that seems more fitting for the Time stuff
but we're not using Time in this so the word doesnt really make sesne
-Should we delete haskell stuff from bottom since that's just copied
